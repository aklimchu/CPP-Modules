# 🚀 CPP Modules (CPP00-CPP09) 

---

## 📌 Introduction 
This repository contains all **C++ modules (CPP00 - CPP09)** from the **Hive School C++ Piscine**. Each module progressively introduces key **C++ programming concepts**, ranging from **basic syntax** to **advanced object-oriented programming, templates, and STL**.

|-----------|---------------|
| CPP00 | Namespace, I/O Streams, Memory Allocation, Classes |
| CPP01 | Pointers, References, Memory Management, File Streams |
| CPP02 | Fixed-Point Arithmetic, Overloading, Orthodox Canonical Form |
| CPP03 | Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes |
| CPP04 | Subtype Polymorphism, Type Identification, Exceptions |
| CPP05 | Exceptions Handling, Custom Exception Classes |
| CPP06 | Type Conversions, Casts, Implicit vs. Explicit Conversion |
| CPP07 | Templates, Function Templates, Class Templates |
| CPP08 | Standard Template Library (STL), Containers, Iterators, Algorithms |
| CPP09 | STL Algorithms, Sorting, Searching, Custom Algorithm Implementation |

Each module contains multiple exercises (ex00, ex01, etc.), focusing on specific **C++ concepts** and **best practices**.

## ⚙️ Compilation & Execution 
To compile a specific exercise, navigate to its directory and run:
```bash
make
./<executive_name>
```

## ⚙️ Learning Outcomes 
By working through these modules, I archived the following:
✅ Mastered **C++ syntax and fundamental concepts**
✅ Gained a **deep understanding of OOP** (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
✅ Worked with **templates and generic programming**
✅ Explored the **Standard Template Library (STL)**
✅ Improved **problem-solving skills** in C++
